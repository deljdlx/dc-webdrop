# ðŸ›œ Webdrop â€“ Airdrop, but for the Web

<!--<SHORT-PRESENTATION>-->
Open a URL, share a URL, drag & drop a file onto a user avatar. **Thatâ€™s it.** ðŸš€
A simple and instant way to transfer files, directly in your browser.

No apps. No setup. Just **pure JavaScript + WebSockets + PHP (Ratchet).**
<!--</SHORT-PRESENTATION>-->

## ðŸ’€ Disclaimers
This project is **a proof of concept** and should **not** be used in production without **major security improvements**.

ðŸ”´ **Whatâ€™s missing?**
- **Encryption & Authentication** â†’ Data is sent as-is, no encryption or user validation.
- **Scalability** â†’ The backend is **not optimized** for handling a large number of users.
- **Security Measures** â†’ No sandboxing, no rate limiting, no protection against abuse.

ðŸ’¡ **But hey, it works. And it's cool.** ðŸ˜Ž
